# Dark_matter_flow_dataset
Dark matter (DM), if exists, is believed to be cold, collisionless, dissipationless, non-baryonic, barely interacting with baryonic matter except through gravity, and sufficiently smooth on large scales with a fluid-like behavior. The flow of dark matter can be best described by a self-gravitating collisionless fluid dynamics (SG-CFD). The statistics of dark matter density, velocity, acceleration, energy, momentum, and their redshift evolution play essential roles for structure formation and evolution. These information can be systematically extracted from cosmological N-body simulations by either i) a structural (halo-based) or ii) a statistical (correlation-based) approach and presented by two individual datasets. 

See two README files for each dataset. The dataset is also available at Zenodo.com
